ukui-panel
===========

ukui-panel contains the UKUI panel, the libukui-panel-applet library and
several applets:

  + the UKUI panel is the area on your desktop from which you can run
    applications and applets, and perform other tasks.

  + the libukui-panel-applet library allows to develop small applications
    which may be embedded in the panel. These are called applets.
    Documentation for the API is available with gtk-doc.

  + the applets supplied here include the Workspace Switcher, the Window
    List, the Window Selector, the Notification Area and the infamous
    'Wanda the Fish'.

ukui-panel is a fork of mate-panel.
